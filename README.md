# NeuralNetwork

## Overview
This repository showcases the implementation of a White Box Neural Network, a TensorFlow Neural Network and a PyTorch Neural Network.

## Features
- **White Box Architecture:** The neural network architecture is designed to be interpretable, making it easier to understand how the model arrives at its predictions.
- **TensorFlow Implementation:** The white box neural network is implemented using TensorFlow, a popular deep learning framework known for its ease of use and scalability.
- **PyTorch Implementation:** Additionally, we provide an alternative implementation of the white box neural network using PyTorch, another widely-used deep learning library.

## Requirements
To run the white box neural network implementations, you need the following:

- Python 3.x
- Libraries:
  - TensorFlow
  - PyTorch
